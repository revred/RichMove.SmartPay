Subject: [CI/V&V] Coverage gate, V&V artifact checks, guardrail defaults, smoke
 scaffold
X-Work-Package: OPS
X-Patch-Name: 1630_VnV_CI_Smoke_Gates.patch

# Why
# Enforce discipline before alpha: tests must run, coverage >=60%, traceability
# file present, and feature flags disabled by default. Include smoke scaffolds.
#
# What
# - GitHub Actions workflow `guardrails.yml`
# - Coverage check using coverlet output (threshold param)
# - Files existence checks: Traceability, WPS index, Smoke_Features.md
# - Simple smoke runner placeholder
#
