# SmartPay Work Package System (WPS) - V&V Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive Work Package System for SmartPay, implementing a rigorous Verification & Validation (V&V) model that ensures every requirement is traceable from work packages through epics, features, capabilities, requirements, acceptance criteria, and tests.

## 🎯 V&V Core Objectives

### ✅ Achieved Objectives
1. **Work Package Documentation**: All WP01-WP12 comprehensively documented with consistent format
2. **Epic Coverage**: Complete traceability from work packages to epic features
3. **Specification Cross-Reference**: All epics, features, and sub-features linked to work packages
4. **V&V Matrix**: Central CSV file tracking all requirements and their verification status
5. **Comprehensive Traceability**: Single source of truth for all cross-references
6. **Clean Organization**: Standardized naming conventions and non-duplicating structure

## 🔄 V&V Traceability Model

### Hierarchical Structure
```
Work Package (WP) → Epic (E) → Feature (F) → Capability (C) → Requirement (R) → Acceptance (A) → Test (T)
      ↓              ↓           ↓              ↓               ↓               ↓             ↓
