| Feature ID | Name | Test IDs | Evidence / Location |
|-----------:|------|----------|---------------------|
| E10.F1 | Partner Integration Framework | SMK-E10-API, INTEG-E10-PARTNER, FUNC-E10-ONBOARD | /partners/api/, /partners/integration/, /partners/onboarding/ |
| E10.F2 | Production Hosting Infrastructure | SMK-E10-DEPLOY, INTEG-E10-SCALE, PERF-E10-AVAILABILITY | /infrastructure/deployment/, /infrastructure/scaling/, /infrastructure/monitoring/ |
| E10.F3 | Go-to-Market Support | SMK-E10-PROVISION, INTEG-E10-BILLING, FUNC-E10-SUPPORT | /gtm/provisioning/, /gtm/billing/, /gtm/support/ |
| E10.F4 | Cost Optimization | SMK-E10-SCALE-ZERO, INTEG-E10-SIZING, COST-E10-MONITOR | /optimization/scaling/, /optimization/sizing/, /optimization/monitoring/ |

### Acceptance
- Partner onboarding completed within 5-day target timeline
- Production hosting infrastructure maintains 99.9% uptime SLA
- Hosting costs remain below $50/month during idle periods
- Partner API integration tests pass with 100% success rate
- Go-to-market platform fully operational for commercial launch

### Rollback
- Revert to previous partner integration methods if new framework fails
- Fallback to existing hosting infrastructure during deployment issues
- Disable cost optimization features if they impact system stability
- Maintain existing billing and support systems during transition
- Preserve partner relationships and service continuity

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: MEDIUM (infrastructure complexity)
- **Business Risk**: HIGH (go-to-market readiness)
- **Operational Risk**: MEDIUM (production hosting responsibility)
