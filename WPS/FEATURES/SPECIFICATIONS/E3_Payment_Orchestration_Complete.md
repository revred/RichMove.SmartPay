# Epic E3: Payment Provider Orchestration - Complete Specification

## Executive Summary
The Payment Provider Orchestration epic enables intelligent routing of payment transactions across multiple payment service providers (PSPs) with automatic failover, optimal provider selection, and unified reconciliation. This capability maximizes payment success rates while minimizing costs and regulatory exposure.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Relying on a single payment provider creates risks: higher failure rates, suboptimal routing, pricing limitations, and single points of failure. Multi-provider orchestration is complex without proper abstraction, requiring manual failover and inconsistent integration patterns.

### Target Users
- **Primary**: E-commerce merchants processing payments
- **Secondary**: Financial operations teams managing payment flows
- **Tertiary**: Compliance teams tracking payment routing

### Success Metrics
- Payment success rate >97% (vs 92% single provider)
- Average processing cost reduction of 15-25%
- Failover time <30 seconds
- Reconciliation accuracy >99.9%
- PCI compliance maintained across all providers
- Zero routing configuration errors

### Business Value
- **Revenue Protection**: $2-5M annually in prevented failed transactions
- **Cost Optimization**: 20% reduction in payment processing fees
- **Risk Mitigation**: No single provider dependency
- **Geographic Expansion**: Native provider support in new markets
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Jurisdiction-specific routing
