# Epic Elaboration Framework for SmartPay Features

## Purpose
Transform high-level epics into exhaustively documented feature specifications with all implicit expectations made explicit.

## Elaboration Levels

### L0: Epic Level
High-level business capability or technical domain

### L1: Feature Level (E#.F#)
Discrete functional units within an epic

### L2: Capability Level (E#.F#.C#)
Specific capabilities within a feature

### L3: Requirement Level (E#.F#.C#.R#)
Detailed requirements for each capability

### L4: Acceptance Criteria (E#.F#.C#.R#.A#)
Measurable criteria for requirement satisfaction

### L5: Test Scenarios (E#.F#.C#.R#.T#)
Specific test cases validating acceptance criteria

## Elaboration Dimensions

For each feature element, we must document:

### 1. Functional Specifications
- **Primary Function**: Core purpose and behavior
- **Input Specifications**: All possible inputs, formats, validations
- **Processing Logic**: Step-by-step algorithms, decision trees
- **Output Specifications**: All outputs, formats, error responses
- **State Transitions**: How feature affects system state

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, resource usage
- **Reliability**: Availability targets, failure modes, recovery
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Scalability**: Load limits, growth patterns, bottlenecks
- **Usability**: User experience expectations, accessibility
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, documentation, monitoring

### 3. Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: External systems, libraries, services
- **APIs**: Contract specifications, versioning, backwards compatibility
- **Data Flows**: Input sources, output destinations, transformations
- **Events**: Triggers, subscriptions, notifications
- **Error Propagation**: How errors flow through the system

### 4. Compliance & Constraints
- **Regulatory**: GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOX, HIPAA requirements
- **Business Rules**: Domain-specific constraints and policies
- **Technical Constraints**: Platform limitations, technology choices
- **Operational Constraints**: Deployment, monitoring, support

### 5. Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **Boundary Conditions**: Min/max values, empty sets, nulls
- **Concurrent Access**: Race conditions, locking, consistency
- **Network Issues**: Timeouts, retries, circuit breakers
- **Data Issues**: Corruption, missing data, format errors
- **Security Threats**: Injection attacks, unauthorized access

### 6. Observability Requirements
- **Logging**: What to log, log levels, structured logging
- **Metrics**: KPIs, SLIs, custom metrics
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing, correlation IDs
- **Alerting**: Alert conditions, severity levels, escalation
- **Dashboards**: Visualization requirements

## Unwritten Expectations to Capture

### User Experience Expectations
- Response feel should be "instant" (<100ms for UI feedback)
- Actions should be reversible where possible
- System should prevent user errors, not just report them
- Progress indicators for operations >1 second
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable

### Developer Experience Expectations
- APIs should be self-documenting and discoverable
- Error messages should guide resolution
- Configuration should have sensible defaults
- Common tasks should require minimal code
- Testing should be straightforward

### Operational Expectations
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Rollback capability within 5 minutes
- Self-healing for transient failures
- Predictable resource consumption
- Clear troubleshooting paths

### Business Expectations
- Audit trail for all financial operations
- Data retention per regulatory requirements
- Multi-currency support from day one
- White-label capability consideration
- Partner integration readiness
