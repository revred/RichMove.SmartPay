# WP09 — Security and Compliance Controls

## Overview
Establishes comprehensive security controls, compliance frameworks, and threat detection capabilities that protect the platform and ensure regulatory adherence across all operations.

## Epic and Feature Coverage
- **E5 (Security & Secret Hygiene)**: Complete security implementation
  - E5.F1.C1 (Security Policy Framework): Governance and policy management
  - E5.F2.C1 (Secret Scanning & Management): Credential protection
  - E5.F3.C1 (Vulnerability Management): Security risk mitigation
  - E5.F4.C1 (Security Monitoring): Threat detection and response

## Business Objectives
- **Primary**: Achieve zero critical security vulnerabilities in production
- **Secondary**: Maintain regulatory compliance (PCI-DSS, SOX, GDPR)
- **Tertiary**: Enable rapid incident detection and response (<5 minutes)

## Technical Scope

### Features Implemented/Planned
1. **Security Policy Framework** ✅
   - Comprehensive security policy documentation
   - Responsible vulnerability disclosure process
   - Security awareness training programs
   - Policy compliance monitoring

2. **Secret Scanning & Management** ✅
   - Pre-commit secret detection with Gitleaks
   - Centralized secret storage in Azure Key Vault
   - Automatic secret rotation capabilities
   - Access control and audit logging

3. **Vulnerability Management** ✅
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Static application security testing (SAST)
   - Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
   - Automated remediation workflows

4. **Security Monitoring** ⏳
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Security event correlation
   - Automated incident response
   - Compliance reporting

### Requirements Traceability
| Requirement ID | Description | Verification Method | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E5.F1.C1.R1 | Comprehensive security policy coverage | Compliance review | ✅ PASS |
| E5.F2.C1.R1 | Comprehensive secret pattern detection | Security scanning | ✅ PASS |
| E5.F3.C1.R1 | Comprehensive dependency coverage | Vulnerability scanning | ✅ PASS |
| E5.F4.C1.R1 | Comprehensive event collection | Security monitoring | ⏳ PLANNED |

### Dependencies
- **Upstream**: WP01 (Repository & Tooling), WP08 (Analytics and Reporting)
- **Downstream**: WP10 (Quality CI/CD and Testing)

## V&V {#vv}
### Feature → Test mapping
| Feature ID | Name | Test IDs | Evidence / Location |
|-----------:|------|----------|---------------------|
| E5.F1 | Security Framework | SMK-E5-Security, SEC-E5-Policy | Security tests (Framework) |
| E5.F2 | Secret Management | SMK-E5-Secrets, SEC-E5-Scan | Secret scanning tests |
| E5.F3 | Vulnerability Mgmt | SMK-E5-Vuln, SEC-E5-Assess | Vulnerability assessments |
| E5.F4 | Security Monitoring | SMK-E5-Monitor, SEC-E5-SOC | SOC monitoring tests |

### Acceptance
- Security policies enforced; secrets properly managed; vulnerabilities remediated; monitoring operational.

### Rollback
- Disable enhanced security features; fallback to basic security controls.

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: HIGH (security complexity)
- **Business Risk**: CRITICAL (regulatory and reputation impact)
