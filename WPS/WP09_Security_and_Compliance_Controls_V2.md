Establishes comprehensive security controls, compliance frameworks, and threat detection capabilities that protect the platform and ensure regulatory adherence across all operations.

## Epic and Feature Coverage
- **E5 (Security & Secret Hygiene)**: Complete security implementation
  - E5.F1.C1 (Security Policy Framework): Governance and policy management
  - E5.F2.C1 (Secret Scanning & Management): Credential protection
  - E5.F3.C1 (Vulnerability Management): Security risk mitigation
  - E5.F4.C1 (Security Monitoring): Threat detection and response

## Business Objectives
- **Primary**: Achieve zero critical security vulnerabilities in production
- **Secondary**: Maintain regulatory compliance (PCI-DSS, SOX, GDPR)
- **Tertiary**: Enable rapid incident detection and response (<5 minutes)
