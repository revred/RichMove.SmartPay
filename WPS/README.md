# Work Packages (WPS)

This directory tracks scoped, incremental plans. Each WP is designed to be independently releasable with explicit gates.

## Index
- **WP4** — Realtime + Multi‑Tenancy + Analytics (scaffold complete; triggers in WP4.1).
- **WP6** — UI & SDK (plan only in this commit).

## Status Keys
- **Plan**: documentation only, no code changes.
- **Scaffold**: wiring + placeholders, no business logic.
- **Feature**: end‑to‑end behavior behind flags.
- **Hardening**: perf, cost, security, and docs.
