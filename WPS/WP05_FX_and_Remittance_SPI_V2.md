## Rate Management Architecture

### Provider Integration Strategy
```
Primary: XE.com API → Rate Calculation Engine
Backup 1: OANDA API → Failover Logic → Aggregated Rates
Backup 2: CurrencyLayer API → Quality Validation → Final Rates
```

### Rate Calculation Algorithm
```csharp
public class RateCalculationEngine
{
    public async Task<FxRate> CalculateRateAsync(string fromCurrency, string toCurrency)
    {
        var marketRates = await _providers.GetConsensusRateAsync(fromCurrency, toCurrency);
        var spread = _spreadCalculator.CalculateSpread(fromCurrency, toCurrency, marketRates.Volume);
        var finalRate = marketRates.MidRate + spread;

        await ValidateRateAccuracy(finalRate, marketRates.MidRate);
        return new FxRate(fromCurrency, toCurrency, finalRate, DateTime.UtcNow);
    }
}
```

### Performance Targets
- **Rate Retrieval**: <500ms for any currency pair
- **Rate Calculation**: <100ms for spread and final rate
- **Provider Failover**: <2 seconds to alternative provider
- **Data Freshness**: Rates updated every 30 seconds maximum

## Conversion Engine Architecture

### Transaction Processing Flow
```
Quote Request → Rate Lock → Conversion Authorization → Settlement Initiation → Confirmation
     ↓              ↓              ↓                      ↓                    ↓
  Rate Validation → Hold Funds → Execute Conversion → Settle Transaction → Notify Client
```
