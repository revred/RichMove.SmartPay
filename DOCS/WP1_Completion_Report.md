## Build & Test Results

### Current Status
```bash
# Build Status
dotnet build ZEN/RichMove.SmartPay.sln
✅ Build succeeded. 0 Warning(s) 0 Error(s)

# Test Status
dotnet test ZEN/RichMove.SmartPay.sln
✅ Passed! - Failed: 0, Passed: 2, Skipped: 0, Total: 2
```

### Test Coverage
- **API Tests**: 2/2 passing (health check, service info)
- **Core Tests**: Ready for domain logic implementation
- **Integration Tests**: Framework established with Testcontainers

---

## Next Steps (WP2 Preparation)

### Ready for WP2 - Core Domain & DB
1. **Database Setup**: Supabase integration ready
2. **Domain Models**: Core project structure established
3. **Testing Framework**: Property-based testing ready for domain logic
4. **CI/CD**: Pipeline ready to enforce quality on new code

### Recommendations
1. Implement domain entities in Core project
2. Set up Supabase database schema
3. Implement Repository pattern in Infrastructure
4. Add domain-specific tests with high coverage

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|---------|------------|---------|
| High coverage threshold blocks development | Medium | Pragmatic test implementation strategy | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Complex CI/CD pipeline | Low | Well-documented, staged approach | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Tool learning curve | Low | Comprehensive documentation provided | ✅ MITIGATED |

## Conclusion

WP1 has been completed successfully with all DoD criteria met. The foundation is solid for proceeding with WP2 (Core Domain & DB). The development environment enforces high quality standards while remaining productive for feature development.

**Stage Gate 1 Decision**: ✅ **GO** - Proceed to WP2
